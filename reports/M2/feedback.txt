- hopefully your concerns regarding the recommender model was resolved during office hours. Other strategies to consider is to look into online learning techniques, or just retrain the model during each inference if you could afford to do so. Another strategy is to only retrain the model every time a certain number of new users join (so the amount of inference that are run on a "outdated" model, and how outdated the model would be is minimized)
